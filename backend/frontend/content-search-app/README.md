#  Capstone project - iTunes app(Content-Search)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Overview
For this Capstone project  I designed a React app that interfaces with "iTunes" search API.
The idea behind the project was to allow an end-user to serach any piece of content they would like from the iTunes store. They would then store the item(piece of content of their choice) in a favourites list and then get links to 
the particular media content that they are looking for.
The fetching of the data using the API is handled by the backend server.(Used REST API's for this)

## Installation of the project 
1.Copy the directory called 'content-search-app' to your local machine.
2.Navigate to the backend(content-search-appp) directory from the command line interface. E.g. cd c:/backend
3.In the command line interface type 'npm install'.
4.Once it has finished installing, type 'npm start'.
5.Navigate to the frontend(content-search-appp) directory from the command line interface. E.g. cd c:/backend/frontend
6.In the command line interface, once again type 'npm install'.
7.Once it has finished installing, type 'npm start'.
8.You have now started both the backend and frontend servers.
9.Open http://localhost:3000 to view the project in your web browser.

## Usage
1. Once you open the project in your browser http://localhost:3000, you will see a search box at the middle of the page, navigation section. 
2. Search for any piece of content. And automatically the site will take you to the route(link) wherer you can view your results

## Security
This app has been secured using [Helmet middleware](https://helmetjs.github.io/). The website says that Helmet is "middleware" that "...helps you secure your Express apps by setting various HTTP headers"
