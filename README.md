# Itunes-Content-Search-Web-App
Itunes Content Search web app. Built with the main focus of removing the hassle of a person having to navigate the entire iStore website for content. Rather, a user can go into the Itunes Content Search web app, and immediately browse what's on the iStore

## Technologies used :
* ReactJS(frontend)
* NodeJS(backend)
* ExpressJS(backend)

## How to start the app :
1). Clone this repo onto your local computer with git clone
2). Navigate to the backend folder and run 'npm start' on your terminal to start the server
3). For the frontend, navigate to the frontend folder and  content-search-app, then run 'npm start'. 
*The project should start running on http://localhost:3000

# Navigation : 
The navigation of the app should be pretty simple. 
On the initial render you'll have an search form and button which you can use to enter and select the type of content
you want to view. E.g :
![Homepage](https://github.com/fanatII1/Itunes-Content-Search-App/blob/main/backend/Documentation%20Image(2).png)

After clicking the serch button, you'll automatically be navigated to the page of the specific content you searched for.
![Content](https://github.com/fanatII1/Itunes-Content-Search-App/blob/main/backend/Documentation%20Image(1).png)

You can then add your content to your favourites and then from there you'lll be taken to the iStore where you can find the specific content you wanted
